## How to Use This Repo

- Navigate to the folder matching the topic you're practicing (e.g., `greedy/`, `dynamic-programming/`)
- Open the problem file (e.g., `fractional-knapsack.py`) to study the solution
- Solve it yourself first, then compare with the provided approach
- Track your progress and revisit problems after a few days


---

## Tips for Effective Practice

- Focus on one pattern at a time until you build intuition
- Use spaced repetition: revisit the same problem after 3, 7, and 14 days
- Solve variations of the same pattern to gain mastery
- Write your own comments before reading the solution to force active recall
