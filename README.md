## 🌳 Binary Tree Patterns

These are grouped under `binary-tree/` and subfolders:

- **Basic Traversals** (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder – recursive and iterative)
- **Advanced Traversals** (Zigzag, Vertical Order, Level Order Bottom-Up)
- **Views of Binary Tree** (Top, Bottom, Left, Right)
- **Tree Properties** (Height, Diameter, Balanced Tree)
- **Lowest Common Ancestor**
- **Path Problems** (Root-to-Leaf, Sum Paths, Max Gain)
- **Tree Construction** (from Inorder + Preorder/Postorder)
- **Binary Tree Conversions** (to DLL, to Sum Tree, etc.)
- **Special Tree Problems** (Deepest Leaves LCA, Maximum Width)

## 🌐 Graph Patterns

Graph-related problems span a wide variety of topics and appear frequently in coding interviews. This repo organizes them into specific subfolders inside the `graphs/` directory:

### Graph Problem Types

- **Clone Graph**: Deep copy of a graph using BFS/DFS.
- **Graph Traversal**
  - `bfs/`: Breadth-First Search
  - `dfs/`: Depth-First Search
- **Connected Components**: Number of islands, friend circles, etc.
- **Topological Sort**: Course schedule, task scheduling
- **Cycle Detection**: Detecting cycles in directed and undirected graphs
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**
  - `dijkstra/`: Dijkstra’s algorithm
  - `bellman-ford/`, `floyd-warshall/` (optional extensions)
- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**: Kruskal's MST, cycle detection
- **Graph Coloring**: Bipartite check, scheduling
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms

Each folder includes problems with readable implementations and comments to help you understand the structure and logic.

## 🧠 How to Use This Repo

- Navigate to the folder matching the topic you're practicing (e.g., `greedy/`, `dynamic-programming/`)
- Open the problem file (e.g., `fractional-knapsack.py`) to study the solution
- Solve it yourself first, then compare with the provided approach
- Track your progress and revisit problems after a few days

---

## 🧰 Language Support

Solutions in this repo are implemented in:

- ✅ C++
- ✅ Python
- ✅ Java

More languages may be added as needed.

## 🧭 Tips for Effective Practice

- Focus on one pattern at a time until you build intuition
- Use spaced repetition: revisit the same problem after 3, 7, and 14 days
- Solve variations of the same pattern to gain mastery
- Write your own comments before reading the solution to force active recall
