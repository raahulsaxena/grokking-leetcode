## ðŸŒ³ Binary Tree Patterns

These are grouped under `binary-tree/` and subfolders:

- **Basic Traversals** (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder â€“ recursive and iterative)
- **Advanced Traversals** (Zigzag, Vertical Order, Level Order Bottom-Up)
- **Views of Binary Tree** (Top, Bottom, Left, Right)
- **Tree Properties** (Height, Diameter, Balanced Tree)
- **Lowest Common Ancestor**
- **Path Problems** (Root-to-Leaf, Sum Paths, Max Gain)
- **Tree Construction** (from Inorder + Preorder/Postorder)
- **Binary Tree Conversions** (to DLL, to Sum Tree, etc.)
- **Special Tree Problems** (Deepest Leaves LCA, Maximum Width)

## ðŸ§  How to Use This Repo

- Navigate to the folder matching the topic you're practicing (e.g., `greedy/`, `dynamic-programming/`)
- Open the problem file (e.g., `fractional-knapsack.py`) to study the solution
- Solve it yourself first, then compare with the provided approach
- Track your progress and revisit problems after a few days

## ðŸ§° Language Support

Solutions in this repo are implemented in:

- âœ… C++
- âœ… Python
- âœ… Java

More languages may be added as needed.

## ðŸ§­ Tips for Effective Practice

- Focus on one pattern at a time until you build intuition
- Use spaced repetition: revisit the same problem after 3, 7, and 14 days
- Solve variations of the same pattern to gain mastery
- Write your own comments before reading the solution to force active recall
